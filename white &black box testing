1.White Box Testing:
White box testing is a software testing technique where the tester has knowledge of the internal code, structure, and logic of the software. 
It involves testing the software's internal workings, such as code paths, logic, and algorithms.
Key difference:
1.White box testing: Testing the code from the inside out.
2.white box testing : Testing performance by Developers.
4. Focus: Testing the software's internal code, structure, and logic.
5. Approach: Code-based, where testers analyze the code and its logic.
6. Testers' knowledge: Knowledge of internal code and structure required.
7. Testing scope: Unit testing, integration testing, and code review.


2.Black Box Testing:
Black box testing is a software testing technique where the tester has no knowledge of the internal code, structure, or logic of the software. 
It involves testing the software's functionality, inputs, and outputs without knowing how it works internally.
key difference:
1. Black box testing: Testing the software from the outside in, without knowing the internal workings.
2. Focus: Testing the software's functionality without knowing the internal code or structure.
3. Approach: Input-output based, where testers provide inputs and observe outputs.
4. Testers' knowledge: No knowledge of internal code or structure required.
5. Testing scope: Functional testing, usability testing, and acceptance testing.
