1. Integration testing:
.The process of testing how different modules or components work together after they have been unit tested. 
.Testers is  done
.To verify that data flows correctly between modules and that their interaction is seamless. 
key point:
1. Verifies interactions: Ensures that individual components or modules work together seamlessly.
2. Detects integration defects: Identifies defects and errors that arise when components interact.
3. Ensures system stability: Verifies that the integrated system is stable and functions as expected.
4. Reduces downstream defects: Catches integration issues early, reducing the likelihood of downstream defects.
5. Improves overall quality: Enhances the overall quality and reliability of the system.
